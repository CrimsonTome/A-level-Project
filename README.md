# A-level-Project 2020/21
## This is my A-level Computer Science project. It is a sorting/searching algorithm visualiser
Sorts included are Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort and Quick sort.  
Searches included are Linear search and Binary search.

Due to this being written a long time ago, it is rather inefficient and likes to crash. In fact it used to only work on a college computer back when i worked on it. So run it at your own risk I guess.
